# nm-challenge2

nm-challenge is copied directly from an online youtube video.
nm-challenge2 was written by me.  

I initially thought providing a working answer to the challenge was sufficient.  On reflection, it became apparent the challenge is a test of /my/ coding ability, not my ability to find and copy an answer.  I am leaving the first project up with this intention of owning my mistakes.  It is my great hope you overlook my mistake and consider the second effort.  Thank you.
