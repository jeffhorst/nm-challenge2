# nm-challenge2

nm-challenge is copied directly from an online youtube video.
nm-challenge2 was written by me.  

I initially thought providing a working answer to the challenge was sufficient.  On reflection, it became apparent the challenge is a test of /my/ coding ability, not my ability to find and copy an answer.  Afterall, NM will not likely have much work for me in which I can directly copy a youtube video.  :)
